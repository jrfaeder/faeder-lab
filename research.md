Our research focuses on developing mathematical and computational methods for understanding complex biological systems, particularly cellular signaling networks.

## Research Areas

### Rule-Based Modeling {#bionetgen}

Rule-based modeling provides a powerful framework for representing and simulating biochemical systems with combinatorial complexity. Our lab develops BioNetGen, which enables:

- Compact specification of molecular interactions
- Automatic generation of reaction networks from rules
- Both deterministic (ODE) and stochastic simulation
- Network-free simulation for very large systems

**Key Software**: [BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org)

### Stochastic Simulation Algorithms

We develop advanced algorithms for simulating stochastic processes in biological systems, including:

- Spatial stochastic simulation methods
- Accelerated stochastic simulation
- Hybrid deterministic-stochastic approaches
- Network-free simulation techniques

These methods allow us to accurately model random fluctuations and spatial heterogeneity in cellular processes.

### Signal Transduction Modeling

Signal transduction pathways are critical for cellular responses to environmental cues. Our research includes:

- Detailed mechanistic models of receptor signaling
- Immune receptor signaling (TCR, BCR, FcεRI)
- Receptor tyrosine kinase pathways
- Crosstalk between signaling networks

### Model Reduction and Analysis

Complex biological models often contain many parameters and species, making them difficult to analyze. We develop methods for:

- Automated model reduction
- Sensitivity analysis
- Parameter estimation and identifiability analysis
- Uncertainty quantification

### Automated Model Construction

We create tools that automatically construct models from:

- Protein interaction databases
- Experimental data
- Literature mining
- Domain knowledge representation

This enables rapid development of large-scale models and hypothesis testing.

## Collaborative Projects

We work with experimental and computational collaborators on diverse biological systems:

- Immune cell signaling
- Cancer systems biology
- Synthetic biology
- Microbial communities
- Pharmacology and drug discovery

## Software Tools

Our lab develops and maintains several open-source software packages:

- **[BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org)**: Rule-based modeling platform
- **NFsim**: Network-free stochastic simulator
- **RuleBender**: Visual interface for BioNetGen
- **PyBioNetGen**: Python interface for BioNetGen

## Funding

Our research is supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other federal agencies.
