## Welcome to the Faeder Lab

Our laboratory is dedicated to developing mathematical models of biological regulatory processes, with a particular focus on signal transduction networks. We create and maintain computational tools that enable researchers to build, simulate, and analyze complex biochemical systems.

### Research Focus

The Faeder Lab specializes in:

- **Rule-based modeling**: Developing efficient methods for specifying and simulating large-scale biochemical networks
- **Stochastic simulation**: Creating advanced algorithms for modeling random processes in biological systems
- **Signal transduction**: Building detailed models of cellular signaling pathways and receptor dynamics
- **Model analysis**: Developing techniques for parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and model reduction
- **Automated model construction**: Building tools that generate models from protein interaction databases

### BioNetGen

Our lab develops and maintains [BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org), a widely-used software platform for rule-based modeling of biochemical systems. BioNetGen allows researchers to compactly represent complex molecular interactions and simulate them using both deterministic and stochastic methods.

### Collaborative Research

We are part of the [Department of Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh and collaborate with researchers across computational biology, systems biology, immunology, and cancer research.

Dr. Faeder is former Pitt co-director of the [Joint Carnegie Mellon–University of Pittsburgh PhD Program in Computational Biology](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/) (2016-2025)
